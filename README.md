# Optical-Path-Simulation

## Introduction
Welcome to the Optical-Path-Simulation project, a simulation tool developed at RWTH Aachen University. This project centers on simulating the trajectory of rays through various optical components and optimizing image quality on a detector.

For more detailed information about the project, please refer to [Project-Overview.pdf](Project-Overview.pdf).

## Key Features
- **Simulation of Photons**: Tracks the path of photons emitted from a subject (e.g., a mouse) through mirrors, filters, lenses, and onto a detector.
- **Image Quality Optimization**: Adjusts optical components to optimize the image captured on the detector.
- **C++**: The software is developed in C++.

## Design and Architecture
- **Modular Components**: The design includes mirrors, filters, lenses, and a detector, each contributing uniquely to the optical system.
- **Software Architecture**: Utilizes advanced software design principles, ensuring efficient and effective simulation processes.

## Getting Started
- Download the required Eigen library from [STCE RWTH Aachen](https://www.stce.rwth-aachen.de/teaching/cppnum-library).
- Follow our detailed setup instructions to get the simulation up and running on your system.
