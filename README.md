The report on the "Optical-Path-Simulation" project provides a detailed overview of the simulation of optical paths in a software developed at RWTH Aachen University. It primarily focuses on simulating the optical path of photons through various components and optimizing the image quality on the detector. The software, written in C++, uses Qt for the GUI. Key components include mirrors, filters, lenses, and a pixel-based detector. The report covers use cases, technical background, system requirements, design aspects like GUI and software architecture, and project management insights. 

Based on this report, I will now update the README file.

# Optical-Path-Simulation

## Introduction
Welcome to the Optical-Path-Simulation project, a groundbreaking simulation tool developed at RWTH Aachen University. This project centers on simulating the trajectory of photons through various optical components and optimizing image quality on a detector.

## Key Features
- **Simulation of Photons**: Tracks the path of photons emitted from a subject (e.g., a mouse) through mirrors, filters, lenses, and onto a detector.
- **Image Quality Optimization**: Adjusts optical components to optimize the image captured on the detector.
- **C++ and Qt Implementation**: The software is developed in C++ with a user-friendly GUI powered by Qt.

## Design and Architecture
- **Modular Components**: The design includes mirrors, filters, lenses, and a detector, each contributing uniquely to the optical system.
- **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**: Offers an intuitive interface for users to interact with the simulation.
- **Software Architecture**: Utilizes advanced software design principles, ensuring efficient and effective simulation processes.

## Getting Started
- Download the required Eigen library from [STCE RWTH Aachen](https://www.stce.rwth-aachen.de/teaching/cppnum-library).
- Follow our detailed setup instructions to get the simulation up and running on your system.
